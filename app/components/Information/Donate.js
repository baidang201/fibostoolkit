      <h5>Dear FOToolkit supporters,</h5>
      <p>
        The <strong>FOToolkit</strong> was forked from EOSToolkit and developed by ilovefibosbp to help making FO accessible to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to your support and votes <strong>ilovefibosbp</strong> now receives block rewards and this helps fund
        further development of the fotoolkit and other FO projects.
      </p>
      <p>However, the goal of ilovefibosbp is to give back to the community.</p>
      <p>
        By donating you will be supporting development of the <strong>FOToolkit</strong> directly, while allowing
        ilovefibosbp to give even more back to those who need it most.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you love the <strong>FOToolkit</strong> as much as I{"'"}ve loved making it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>&hearts;,</strong>
        <br />
        Team ilovefibosbp
      </p>
